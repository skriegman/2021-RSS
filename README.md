# Requirements



In order to run this code you'll need to install [voxcraft-sim](https://voxcraft.github.io/design).

Once compiled, you'll have two executables: 
```voxcraft-sim``` and ```vxa_node_worker```.

Copy these into the fractals and nonfractals directories 
and run the main.py script using
<b>python 2.7</b> with networkx <2.0.

    pip install networkx==1.11
